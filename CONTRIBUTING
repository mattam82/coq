Guidelines for contributing to the Coq project.

Repositories:

The main Coq codebase is available at gforge.inria.fr and mirrored on http://github.com/coq/coq.git

Pull-requests:

Contributing to the Coq system works by submitting pull-requests to the
Coq repository on github, where the contributions are discussed,
reviewed, integrated or rejected. PRs to be integrated have to pass the
tests on travis, be documented if applicable, and tests have to be
included for any new feature or bug fix.

Reviews, approvals:

Depending on the impact and complexity of the contribution, the PR
author, release manager or any core team member might require reviews on
independently of the integration dissussion. By policy, we require at
least one other developer to give its ok before a PR is merged.

Roadmap, releases:

Coq is developed according to a time-based release schedule, which is
announced shortly after each release. It consists in 6 to 10 months
cycles approximately including: 5-month merge window ended by a feature
freeze and branching for the beta release, plus a 2-3 month beta cycle
involving minor changes only.

The team tries to maintain a roadmap of the features being worked on or wished for
(on the Coq wiki?)

PRs not considered for merging in a version are automatically regargeted
to a later version. The core development team reserves the right to
revert any contribution.
